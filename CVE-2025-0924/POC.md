## Technical Analysis

### Attack Flow
1. **Initial Injection:** Attacker creates WordPress content with malicious scripts
2. **Log Generation:** WP Activity Log records the activity with unsanitized input
3. **Trigger Point:** Administrator views log details through "More details..." feature

// Vulnerable code in AuditLog.php (v5.2.2)
public function AjaxInspector() {
    $occurrence = $this->get_occurrence();
    $metadata = $occurrence->get_meta_array();
    // Missing esc_html() sanitization
    return $metadata;
}

### Attack Demonstration
# Step 1: Create Malicious Content
Navigate to WordPress Posts → Add New

Insert XSS payload in post title or content:

```
<script>alert('XSS via WP Activity Log')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('Stored XSS')>
```
# Step 2: Trigger Log Generation
Save/publish the post

WP Activity Log automatically records the activity

Malicious script is stored in the activity log database

# Step 3: Execute Payload
Navigate to WP Activity Log → Activity Log

Locate the logged post creation activity

Click "More details..." to view metadata

XSS payload executes in administrator context
