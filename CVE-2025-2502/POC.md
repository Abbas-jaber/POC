CVE-2025-2502 — Lenovo Device Manager: Local Privilege Escalation (POC)
While studying local privilege escalation techniques in a Windows lab, I installed Lenovo Device Manager to inspect its installed components. 
Browsing the ProgramData modules out of curiosity, I noticed oddly permissive ACLs on the module directories — files downloaded by the application 
were writable by standard users.

That raised a red flag: if a service binary stored in such a directory runs as LocalSystem, and a non-privileged user can alter the file content, 
a simple replace-and-reboot could make the service execute attacker-controlled code as SYSTEM.

To validate this hypothesis without impacting production systems, I built an isolated VM testbed (host-only network) and reproduced the conditions: 
install the vulnerable Device Manager + AI Picture plugin, confirm the file ACLs, inspect the service, and observe the service launching the binary 
as LocalSystem after replacement and reboot. The lab confirmed the escalation vector end-to-end.

In short:
TL;DR: A permissions flaw in Lenovo Device Manager (all versions observed) grants non-privileged users F (Full) control over downloaded tool binaries 
under C:\ProgramData\Lenovo\devicecenter\modules\…. A privileged service (KPICService_Lenovo) loads one such binary as LocalSystem; because an unprivileged 
user can replace that binary on disk, the service will start the replaced binary as SYSTEM after a reboot — enabling local privilege escalation. 
This writeup documents discovery, a high-level reproduction approach used in a controlled lab, indicators, and mitigations.
