## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**I did not discover the CVE(s) referenced in this repository.** I collected public CVE records and vendor advisories, and attempted to reproduce or demonstrate conceptual proof-of-concept behavior in isolated lab environments only. This work is for research, education, and defensive testing. I do not provide or distribute weaponized exploit code, and I do not endorse unauthorized testing against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

**By using the material in this document you confirm that you will only test in environments you own or where you have written permission.** Follow all applicable laws and vendor disclosure policies.

**Remember:** Always test responsibly and legally.
